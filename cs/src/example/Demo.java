 *         Aims: The goal of our small program is to produce an amount of
 *         change in American coins equal to a target amount in the fewest
 *         possible number of coins, it seems reasonable that the measure of
 *         fitness for a particular solution would be a combination of the
 *         relative closeness of the amount of change it represented to the
 *         target amount of change, and the total number of coins represented by
 *         the solution (fewer being better).
